1. Civi infrastructure including bridges, dams, and skyscapers are becoming susceptible to losing their designed functions as they 
deteriorate from use. Onsite inspections still require closing bridge systems or building structures to diagnose them, which is time
consuming and costly. 

2. A number of vison-based methods for detecting damages, primarily using image processing techniques, have been propsed to redeem 
the complexities. One significant advantage of IPTs is that almost all superficial defects can are likely identifiable. An early 
comparative study on finding concrete cracks using four edge detection methods - fast Haar tranform, fast Fourier transform, Sobel 
edge detector and Canny edge detector.
